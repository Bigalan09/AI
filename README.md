# AI

**NOTE: This is just for fun and servces no purpose.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.
Mainly playing around with machine learning, steering behaviors, electron, canvas and ES6.
